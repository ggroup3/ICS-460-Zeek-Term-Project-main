<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project develops a real-time network log file analyzer designed to process and visualize network traffic data effectively. Utilizing Zeek for robust data extraction, our system is paired with a custom Python GUI application to analyze and manage the data collected. The GUIï¿½s functionalities entail:

- **File Selection**: Users can choose specific log directories and files for analysis through a file dialog interface.
- **Live Traffic Monitoring**: The system can analyze network logs in real-time to provide up-to-date information about network activity.
- **Data Filtering**: Logs can be filtered by protocols to focus on specific types of network traffic.
- **Summary and Analysis Display**: The application displays a summary of the network traffic, including the number of connections, most common protocols, and top network talkers. It also identifies and highlights suspicious activities, such as failed connection attempts.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Protocol distribution is visually represented through bar graphs, aiding in the quick assessment of network traffic status.

With these features, our program offers a powerful tool for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to enhance their monitoring capabilities and improve network security measures.
